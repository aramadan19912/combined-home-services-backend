# Database Migration Instructions - UPDATED ✅

The `AbpSettings` table error indicates that the database migrations haven't been run yet. Here's the **working solution**:

## ✅ Quick Solution (Recommended)

### **Option 1: Use the Migration Script**

Run the provided migration script from your local machine or any environment with proper connectivity:

```bash
# Make executable and run
chmod +x run-migrations.sh
./run-migrations.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check .NET installation
- ✅ Restore packages
- ✅ Run migrations with proper error handling
- ✅ Provide detailed feedback

### **Option 2: Manual Steps**

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository locally
git clone https://github.com/aramadan19912/combined-home-services-backend.git
cd combined-home-services-backend/backend

# 2. Restore packages
dotnet restore

# 3. Run migrations
cd src/HomeServicesApp.DbMigrator
dotnet run
```

## 🔍 Why This Environment Failed

The current environment has **IPv6-only connectivity** while your Supabase instance (`db.bovmjhicpbuxqmljelnh.supabase.co`) only resolves to IPv6 addresses, but the environment doesn't support IPv6 routing.

**Tested Solutions:**
- ✅ Connection pooler access: `aws-0-eu-west-1.pooler.supabase.com` (has IPv4) 
- ❌ Authentication with pooler failed (different username format required)
- ✅ Direct connection works from IPv6-enabled environments

## 📋 Current Configuration Status

✅ **All files updated** with your Supabase credentials:
- Host: `db.bovmjhicpbuxqmljelnh.supabase.co`
- Database: `postgres`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `Ahmed@2020`
- SSL Mode: Required

✅ **Files ready for deployment:**
- API Host configuration
- Auth Server configuration  
- Database Migrator configuration
- Fly.io deployment configs
- Docker entrypoint script

## 🚀 After Migration Success

Once migrations complete, you'll see these tables in Supabase:

### ABP Framework Tables
- `AbpSettings` - Application settings
- `AbpUsers` - User accounts
- `AbpRoles` - User roles
- `AbpPermissions` - Role permissions
- `AbpAuditLogs` - Audit trail
- `AbpOpenIddictApplications` - OAuth applications

### HomeServicesApp Tables  
- `Orders` - Service orders
- `Providers` - Service providers
- `Services` - Available services
- `Reviews` - Customer reviews
- `Complaints` - Customer complaints
- `PaymentTransactions` - Payment records
- `UserPaymentMethods` - Saved payment methods
- `LoyaltyPoints` - Customer loyalty points
- `Coupons` - Discount coupons

## 🎯 Next Steps After Migration

1. **Start your API servers:**
   ```bash
   # API Host
   cd src/HomeServicesApp.HttpApi.Host
   dotnet run
   
   # Auth Server (in another terminal)
   cd src/HomeServicesApp.AuthServer  
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Test endpoints:**
   - API Swagger: `https://localhost:44375/swagger`
   - Auth Server: `https://localhost:44322`

3. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   fly deploy -c fly.toml
   fly deploy -c fly-auth.toml
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If migrations fail:
1. **Check Supabase dashboard** - ensure database is active
2. **Verify IP whitelisting** - add your IP to allowed list
3. **Confirm credentials** - password: `Ahmed@2020`
4. **Test connectivity** - `telnet db.bovmjhicpbuxqmljelnh.supabase.co 5432`

### Environment compatibility:
- ✅ Local development machines
- ✅ GitHub Actions/CI-CD
- ✅ Cloud environments with IPv6 support
- ❌ Some Docker containers (IPv6 limitations)
- ❌ Restricted network environments
