```

### Step 2: Configure Domain DNS

**At Namecheap (or any registrar):**

1. Login to your domain registrar
2. Go to domain management
3. Find "DNS Settings" or "Nameservers"
4. Choose "Custom DNS" or "Advanced DNS"
5. Add these records:

```
Type    Host    Value               TTL
A       @       YOUR_VPS_IP         300
A       www     YOUR_VPS_IP         300
```

**Example:**
```
A       @       123.45.67.89        300
A       www     123.45.67.89        300
```

### Step 3: Wait for DNS Propagation
