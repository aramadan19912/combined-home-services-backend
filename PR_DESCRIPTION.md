### 🔧 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

```
Push to GitHub → Run Tests → Build → Deploy to VPS → Health Check → Notify
```

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Test Stage**
   - Backend tests (.NET)
   - Frontend build (React + TypeScript)
   - Build validation

2. **Deploy Stage**
   - Build production artifacts
   - Upload via SSH to VPS
   - Create automatic backups
   - Zero-downtime deployment
   - Run database migrations

3. **Verify Stage**
   - Health checks
   - Service status verification
   - Automatic rollback if failed

4. **Rollback Stage** (on failure)
   - Restore previous backend version
   - Restore previous frontend version
   - Restart all services

### 📖 How to Use

**Quick Setup (30 minutes):**

1. **Setup VPS:**
   ```bash
   scp scripts/setup-vps.sh root@your-vps-ip:/root/
   ssh root@your-vps-ip "bash /root/setup-vps.sh"
   ```

2. **Generate SSH Key:**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/hostinger_deploy
   ```

3. **Configure GitHub Secrets:**
   Required secrets to add in GitHub Settings → Secrets:
   - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Private key content
   - `VPS_HOST` - VPS IP address
   - `VPS_USER` - deployer
   - `DOMAIN_NAME` - your-domain.com
   - `DB_NAME` - homeservices
   - `DB_USER` - homeservices_user
   - `DB_PASSWORD` - Your database password
   - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - https://your-domain.com/api
   - `VITE_AUTH_API_BASE_URL` - https://your-domain.com/api

4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main  # Automatic deployment!
   ```

**Manual Deployment:**
```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.deploy.example .env.deploy
# Edit with your details
nano .env.deploy
# Deploy
./scripts/deploy-to-hostinger.sh
```

**Rollback:**
```bash
./scripts/rollback.sh  # Latest backup
./scripts/rollback.sh 20241012_143022  # Specific backup
