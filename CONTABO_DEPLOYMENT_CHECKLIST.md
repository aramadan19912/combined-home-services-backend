# Contabo Deployment Checklist âœ…

Quick checklist to deploy your Home Services Platform to Contabo VPS.

## ðŸ“‹ Before You Start

- [ ] Received Contabo email with VPS IP and password
- [ ] Have terminal/SSH client ready
- [ ] (Optional) Have domain name ready

---

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Your VPS

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
```

- [ ] Connected successfully
- [ ] Changed root password: `passwd`

### Step 2: Update System

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

- [ ] System updated (takes 2-5 minutes)

### Step 3: Download and Run Setup Script

```bash
curl -o setup-vps.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aramadan19912/combined-home-services-backend/main/scripts/setup-vps.sh
chmod +x setup-vps.sh
bash setup-vps.sh
```

When prompted, enter:
- [ ] Domain name (or just use your VPS IP for now)
- [ ] Email address (for SSL certificate)
- [ ] Database password (create a strong one - save it!)
- [ ] SSH public key (from your local machine)

### Step 4: Generate SSH Key (On Your Local Machine)

Open a NEW terminal on your local machine:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/contabo_deploy
```

Get your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/contabo_deploy.pub
```

- [ ] SSH key generated
- [ ] Public key copied

Paste this public key when the VPS setup script asks for it.

### Step 5: Buy Domain (Optional)

If you don't have one yet:

- [ ] Go to Namecheap.com
- [ ] Buy domain ($8.88/year for .com)
- [ ] Save domain name

### Step 6: Configure Domain DNS (If you have a domain)

In your domain registrar (Namecheap, etc.):

Add these DNS records:
```
Type: A Record
Host: @
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP

Type: A Record
Host: www
Value: YOUR_VPS_IP
```

- [ ] DNS records added
- [ ] Wait 5-30 minutes for propagation

### Step 7: Setup GitHub Secrets

Go to: `https://github.com/aramadan19912/combined-home-services-backend/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these secrets:

- [ ] `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` - Copy from: `cat ~/.ssh/contabo_deploy`
- [ ] `VPS_HOST` - Your Contabo VPS IP
- [ ] `VPS_USER` - Enter: `deployer` (or `root`)
- [ ] `DOMAIN_NAME` - Your domain (or VPS IP if no domain)
- [ ] `DB_NAME` - Enter: `homeservices`
- [ ] `DB_USER` - Enter: `homeservices_user`
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD` - The password you created in Step 3
- [ ] `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - `https://yourdomain.com/api` (or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP/api`)
- [ ] `VITE_AUTH_API_BASE_URL` - Same as above

### Step 8: Deploy!

Push to trigger deployment:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Or re-run the workflow in GitHub Actions:
1. Go to GitHub â†’ Actions tab
2. Click on the workflow
3. Click "Re-run all jobs"

- [ ] Deployment started
- [ ] Wait 5-8 minutes
- [ ] Check deployment logs for success

### Step 9: Verify Deployment

Visit your site:
- [ ] Frontend loads: `https://yourdomain.com` (or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP`)
- [ ] API responds: `https://yourdomain.com/api` (or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP/api`)

Test login:
- [ ] Can register new account
- [ ] Can login with email/password
- [ ] Can access dashboard
