# Deploy NOW - Complete Checklist üöÄ

You bought your VPS! Let's get your app deployed in 30 minutes.

## üìß Step 1: Get Your VPS Information

Check your **Hostinger email** for:
- [ ] **VPS IP Address** (e.g., `123.45.67.89`)
- [ ] **Root Password** (or SSH access details)
- [ ] **VPS Control Panel URL**

---

## üîê Step 2: First Login to VPS

Open terminal and connect:

```bash
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP
```

- [ ] Connected successfully
- [ ] Type `yes` when asked about fingerprint
- [ ] Enter password from email

**Change root password (recommended):**
```bash
passwd
```

---

## üîß Step 3: Update System & Run Setup

**Copy and paste these commands:**

```bash
# Update system
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# Download setup script
curl -o setup-vps.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aramadan19912/combined-home-services-backend/main/scripts/setup-vps.sh

# Make it executable
chmod +x setup-vps.sh

# Run setup script
bash setup-vps.sh
```

**The script will ask you for:**

1. **Domain name:** 
   - If you have one: `yourdomain.com`
   - If not: Just press Enter or use VPS IP

2. **Email for SSL:**
   - Your email address

3. **Database password:**
   - Create a strong password (save it!)
   - Example: `MySecurePass123!`

4. **SSH public key:**
   - We'll generate this next (for now, press Enter to skip)

- [ ] Setup script completed
- [ ] Note down the database password you created

---

## üîë Step 4: Generate SSH Key for GitHub Actions

**On your LOCAL computer** (not VPS), open a NEW terminal:

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/github_deploy

# Press Enter for all prompts (no passphrase)
```

**Get your PUBLIC key:**
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/github_deploy.pub
```

**Add public key to VPS:**

Back in your VPS terminal:
```bash
# Create SSH directory if not exists
mkdir -p ~/.ssh

# Paste your public key here (replace with actual key)
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_FROM_ABOVE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- [ ] SSH key generated
- [ ] Public key added to VPS

---

## üåê Step 5: Get Domain (Optional)

**If you don't have a domain yet:**

Option A: **Buy from Namecheap** ($8.88/year)
- Go to https://namecheap.com
- Search for your domain
- Buy .com domain

Option B: **Use VPS IP for now**
- You can deploy without domain
- Add domain later

**If you have a domain, configure DNS:**

In your domain registrar (Namecheap, etc.):
1. Go to DNS Settings
2. Add A Record:
   - Host: `@`
   - Value: `YOUR_VPS_IP`
3. Add A Record:
   - Host: `www`
   - Value: `YOUR_VPS_IP`

- [ ] Domain configured (or skipped for now)

## üöÄ Step 7: Deploy!

### Option A: Trigger Deployment via Push

```bash
# On your local machine
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger deployment to Hostinger"
git push origin main
```

### Option B: Re-run GitHub Actions

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Click on latest workflow run
3. Click **"Re-run all jobs"**

- [ ] Deployment triggered
- [ ] Wait 5-8 minutes

---

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Verify Deployment

### Check GitHub Actions:
1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
2. Watch the deployment progress
3. Check all steps pass ‚úÖ

### Check Your Site:
Visit your application:
- [ ] **Frontend:** `https://yourdomain.com` (or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP`)
- [ ] **API:** `https://yourdomain.com/api` (or `http://YOUR_VPS_IP/api`)

### Test Login:
- [ ] Can register new account
- [ ] Can login
- [ ] Dashboard loads

---

## üéâ Success!

If everything works:
- ‚úÖ Your app is LIVE!
- ‚úÖ CI/CD is configured
- ‚úÖ Push to main = automatic deployment

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed?

**Check logs:**
```bash
# SSH to VPS
ssh root@YOUR_VPS_IP

# Check backend service
sudo systemctl status homeservices-api

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u homeservices-api -n 50 --no-pager
```

**Check Nginx:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t
```

**Restart services:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart homeservices-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Can't Access Website?

**Check firewall:**
```bash
sudo ufw status
```

Should show:
- 22/tcp (SSH)
- 80/tcp (HTTP)
- 443/tcp (HTTPS)

**Add rules if missing:**
```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw reload
```

### GitHub Actions Fails?

**Common issues:**
1. SSH_PRIVATE_KEY not set correctly
2. VPS_HOST wrong IP
3. VPS_USER wrong username
4. Firewall blocking connection

**Check secrets:**
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Secrets
- Verify all 9 secrets are set
- Check for typos

## üìä What You Should See

### In GitHub Actions:
```
‚úì Run Tests
‚úì Build Frontend
‚úì Build Backend
‚úì Deploy to VPS
